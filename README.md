## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
AI-Driven Multimodal Crop and Irrigation Recommendation System

1.This project presents a smart agricultural solution that helps farmers select the best crops and manage water usage effectively. The system accepts multiple input formats including soil images, videos, audio, text notes, lab soil reports, and land details such as area and irrigation type. Each input is processed through image recognition, speech-to-text, video frame analysis, and text normalization. The data is then combined with external sources like weather forecasts and satellite indices for accurate decision-making.

2.A soil suitability model evaluates the combined data to recommend crops suited to current conditions. If the soil is unsuitable, the system suggests improvement steps along with alternative crops. For suitable cases, a water requirement calculator estimates irrigation needs using parameters like evapotranspiration, crop coefficients, and irrigation efficiency. Crops are then ranked based on water efficiency, expected yield, and environmental suitability.

3.The final recommendations are delivered through a multilingual chatbot supporting regional languages such as Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, and Kannada. The chatbot provides farmers with easy-to-understand outputs: best crop options, required water, planting schedules, and soil improvement tips. Farmers can accept or reject recommendations. Feedback is captured to refine the model, ensuring continuous improvement. Accepted recommendations automatically generate irrigation schedules and real-time alerts for ongoing farm monitoring.

4.By combining AI, weather data, soil databases, and satellite imagery, this solution empowers farmers with personalized, reliable advice. It promotes sustainable farming, improves yield, saves water, and provides locally adapted support through an accessible, farmer-friendly platform.

## Feasibility and Viability
Technically feasible using Python for AI/ML model training, Java for Android app development, Firebase for real-time data storage, and IoT devices for on-field monitoring.

Weather and soil APIs are widely available and can be integrated easily.

Multilingual chatbot support is achievable through NLP libraries and translation APIs.

Pilot trials in Punjab villages are practical due to the presence of agriculture-focused communities and infrastructure.

Economically viable if low-cost IoT devices and open-source technologies are used.

Scalable across India with localization of datasets and language support.

Socially viable as it addresses key farmer needs: crop choice, water management, and pest detection.

Long-term viability supported by potential government, NGO, and agri-tech partnerships.

## Impact and Benefits
Increased Crop Yield: AI-driven crop recommendations help farmers select the most suitable crops for their soil and climate, improving productivity.

Efficient Water Usage: Water requirement estimation and irrigation scheduling optimize water consumption, reducing wastage.

Early Pest & Disease Detection: IoT sensors and image analysis help identify pests, viruses, and harmful creatures early, minimizing crop loss.

Farmer Empowerment: Multilingual chatbot provides easy-to-understand guidance, making advanced technology accessible to all farmers.

Sustainable Farming: Data-driven insights promote soil health, crop rotation, and environmentally responsible practices.

Scalability: The system can be expanded to multiple regions, incorporating local datasets, languages, and environmental conditions.

Economic Benefits: Higher yields and optimized resource use lead to increased income and reduced costs for farmers.
